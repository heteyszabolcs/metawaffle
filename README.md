# Introduction
H3.3 KO vs. H3.3 WT differential G4 scCut&Tag analysis has resulted in unique G4 peaks over LTR sequences.
These peaks have overlapped with BRG1 peaks and also with H3K9me3 peaks. BRG1 is a component of mammalian SWI/SNF and Rsc chromatin-remodelling complexes.

Profile plots were also made. Based on these plots we could see that in H3.3 KO cells these G4 regions will be more accessible (ATAC-Seq data). So H3.3 is needed for compactness and presumably for G4 structure. In the case of H3.3 KO the H3K27ac is also elevated.

The unique G4 regions harbour KLF4 pioneer TF binding sites and motifs. OCT4 and SOX2 master regulators are also enriched.

Potential hypothesis/model: KLF4 is recruited. Then, BRG1 remodelling protein goes there and makes chromatin remodelling. With this the nucleosome turnover will be influenced as well. DAXX might be also involved in.
